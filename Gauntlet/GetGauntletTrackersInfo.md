## Comment
I missed out on documenting this. It's a retired feature as of awakening. I remember there being information about tracker progress communicated over this endpoint. For the awakening version refer to [SearchPublic.md#tags=gauntlet_store](../Store/Product/Skus/SearchPublic.md#tagsgauntlet_store).
